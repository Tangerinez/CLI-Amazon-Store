# CLI-Amazon-Store

An amazon-like storefront using Node.js and MySQL

Created user functionality for mock Amazon storefront. Integrated inquirer into the CLI application so that user experience is more intuitive. User can view items in the "Amazon" store and purchase items from the database. Items in the database will be updated after the user decides to purchase that item.
